# Motivation
I started this game engine project because:
- I want to sharpen my skills; 
- I like to recreate things by hand; 
- I want to have full control of all the processes from code to the delivery;
- I want a job as a Game Engine Developer.

# Why C++
- Has many solid, well maintained, efficient and stable libs;
- It speaks straight to hardware, you can do whatever you want;
- It is portable.

# Why C++14
Mostly because of [this compiller support table](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support). I wish I could 
use coroutines and many other fancy C++20 features, but just think on the frustration in developing lots of cool 
stuff and then you discover it wont work on a specific console compiler? So better safe than sorry.

# Why CMAKE
It is the best all-around solution to:
- Create projects cross platform
- Configure variables and flags
- Build complex projects in a easy way
- Most relevant libs supports it 

# Why CPP-PM
- Best package manager to import and use third party libs from source code with low maintainance code.
